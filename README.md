**It was a invoice processor which processed invoices and I added a tweak to it like **
user can select :-
  1.Process an invoice to extract data
  2.Enter new invoices to it
  3. update exsisting invoices(this feature needs to be added still and thinking upon the idea )
  4. view the processed invoices
**I have used llmware,ps,re library to create it and modules from llmware that are used are:-**
  **1.llmware.prompts:-** Provides functionality for generating prompts and human-in-the-loop interactions.
  **2.llmware.configs:** Contains configurations for the LLMWare system.
  **3.llmware.setup:** Handles the setup and initialization of the LLMWare environment.
  **4.llmware.models:** Offers access to different LLM models available in the system.
